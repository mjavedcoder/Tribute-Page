            Elon Musk, is not only a billionaire-entrepreneur, but is also the
            richest person alive. On the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, he ranks
            first with a net worth of $ 252 billion. He is also on top of the
            Forbes Rich List with a net worth of $264 billion. Let us take a
            deep dive into what all avenues he has locked his wealth in. Musk
            owns around 17 per cent stake in Tesla Inc., which is a publicly
            listed company. Tesla is an American electric vehicle and clean
            energy company based in Austin, Texas. They design and manufacture
            electric cars, battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar
            panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. As
            per Yahoo Finance, Tesla's market cap stood at $1.018 trillion. This
            means Elon's 17 per cent sums up to a little over $170 billion. Elon
            also has a major share in SpaceX, which is a private company. SpaceX
            is an aviation and aerospace company that designs, manufactures, and
            launches advanced rockets and spacecraft in collaboration with space
            agencies like NASA. As per news reports, SpaceX's valuation crossed
            $100 billion in October of last year after a secondary share sell by
            insiders.This new valuation of the company shot up to $100.3 billion
            from $74 billion. As per fillings from 2020, Musk owns around 40 per
            cent share in the aviation company. This means his share in SpaceX
            amounts to around 40 billion.
